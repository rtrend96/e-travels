Mughal Emperor Jehangir described Kashmir as 'Paradise on Earth'. Such is the beauty of its serene lakes, magnificent valleys and snow-clad peaks.
 In this holiday package, you will see saffron fields, sulphur springs, Persian-style gardens, golden meadows and slopes covered by a thick blanket of snow. These marvels will continue to bring a smile to your face even years after your trip to this Jannat.
